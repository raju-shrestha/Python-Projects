# Rock Paper Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors is a game developed using a python programming language which usually played between two players( a computer and a person).
Each player simultaneously chooses one that is either Rock or Paper or Scissors. 

The winner is decided by a set of rules: 
- Rock beats scissors
- Scissors beat paper
- Paper beats rock
-  If both players choose the same thing, there is no winner for that round.
